> A minecraft mod which brings more adventure into the vanilla experience

Adventure Mode is a Minecraft modification which aims to bring more adventures into Minecraft 
without changing too much of the vanilla experience.

## Background
Adventure Mode does not try to bring more and more content in form of mobs, blocks, dimensions 
or other stuff. Instead it tries to take what is there and reorganize everything into a more 
challenging and compelling presentation.

## Requirements

- [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/)
- [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
  (Please check the releases to see which version of Forge/Minecraft is supported)

## Installation
### Releases

Download the matching release from the [releases](https://github.com/rampage128/adventuremode/releases)
and put it in your minecraft mods folder.

__Please make sure to read the [requirements](#requirements) above__!

### From source

1. Get an IDE ([IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)).
2. Get the [Forge MDK](https://files.minecraftforge.net/).
3. Unpack the Forge MDK and rename the project folder to `adventuremode`.
4. Clone the repository into the Forge MDK folder:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rampage128/adventuremode.git

## Usage/Features

- __Sledge hammer__
  New sledge hammer tool. Costs more ressources, has less durability than the pickaxe but 
  destroys any kind of rock in bunches of up to 26 blocks!
- __Realistic tools__
  Vanilla tools (pickaxe, shovel ...) are replaced with new adventure-tools. Adventure-tools 
  last much longer but get worn out (working speed degrades with damage)!
- __Random Monster Invasions__
  Monster invasions (including configurable monsters) are spawned around a player on special 
  ocassions (thunderstorms, full moon, ...). Invasions have a time and kill limit!
- __Random Boss Events__
  Boss events are created around the player. These Events include a strong boss monster and 
  a random amount of add monsters!
- __Event Indicator__
  Indicator showing a little line of text for events near the player. Each event has unique 
  messages which will be displayed!
